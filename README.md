# Pair Programming and Moon Walk Telegram Bot

This Telegram bot is designed to pair students for **Pair Programming** and **Moon Walk** sessions at A2SV. The bot allows admins to create and manage pairings for each session, ensuring that students are paired equally and without repetition.

## Features

- **Pair Programming**:
  - Pair students together and assign them LeetCode problems to solve.
  - Admin selects the group and provides LeetCode question titles.
  - Students are paired randomly for each session, with no repetition.
  
- **Moon Walk**:
  - Pair students together and encourage them to converse in English to improve communication skills.
  - Admin selects the group, and the bot generates random student pairings.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (version 14 or higher recommended).
- Telegram bot token (You can obtain one by creating a bot through [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather)).
- MongoDB database (for storing student data and pairings).
